# Type Here: A Powerful Textarea

A textarea (with vim)

## Inspirations

I used to use typehere.co a lot until the site was taken down, so I created [typehere.app](https://typehere.app). For a long while, it was also just a textarea that saved its contents to `localStorage`, but recently I've decided to add more features that I would find useful myself.

## How To Use

- Most things are in the ctrl/cmd-K menu. I will call it cmd-K for this guide.
- Cmd-K uses fuzzy search. There are two types of things that cmd-K has: notes and commands.
  - Notes are the notes you've created, commands are things like theme toggle, vim toggle, show/hide scrollbar, import/export, etc.
- Navigate in the Cmd-K menu by up/down arrows.
- Create a new note by typing the note title and run the create note command.
  - Or you could do cmd+shift+enter. 
- Enter a note or run a command by pressing "Enter" or clicking on it.
- Workspaces is the way to separate notes into different "groups" under cmd-K.
  - You can create a workspace by doing cmd-K, type in a workspace name, and "Create workspace". This creates a workspace with an empty note.
  - You can switch between workspaces in cmd-K by doing left/right arrow keys.
  - You can also switch between workspace by just typing in the workspace name you want to go to and run the command.
  - You can select a note you want (arrow up/down), and cmd + left/right arrow to move it between workspace.
  - If there are no notes in a workspace, the workspace is automatically deleted. Under the hood, each note has a workspace string, and all workspace is just a set of all the notes workspaces.
- For vim/keyboard-only users (like me)
  - Toggle vim by doing cmd-K, toggle vim.
  - Arrow up/down keys work the same as cmd+J/K inside the cmd-K menu.
  - Cmd+B to open a note. This means to switch between the top two notes, hold cmd, and press K-J-B.
  - Cmd+U/I to switch between workspaces.
  - Cmd+E to toggle narrow screen view.
  - Cmd+G to pin a note to all workspaces. this means the note will be displayed no matter which workspace you're in.
  - Cmd+H to hide a note. In order to access hidden notes, you need to type the first 5 characters of the title right in the cmd-K menu.

## Other Features

- Offline mode 
- Everything client-side, all in `localStorage`
- Periodically backed up to `indexedDB` (also in your browser)
- Import/export notes
- Desktop app (build on own machine)
